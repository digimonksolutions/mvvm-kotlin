# Crypto Capital - MVVM pattern kotlin
The Crypto Capital - App consuming a [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) to display top 100 crypto coins it has been built with implementation of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern in Kotlin. It demonstrates how to separate concerns between the UI, business logic, and data layers to create a maintainable, scalable, and testable application.

This app also shows the usage of the Navigation Architecture Component.

**App features:**
- List of Top 100 Crypto Coins
- Detail of Coins
- Price changes of coin in a graph

## Architecture
The MVVM architecture pattern is a way of separating the concerns of the UI, business logic, and data layers. The goal of MVVM is to create a maintainable, scalable, and testable application by isolating each layer and making it easy to swap out components.

## Packages:
* **ui** - It uses all the components and classes related to Android Framework.
* **data** - The data layer contains the *remote* module to get data from web server using retrofit and the *repository* module which acts as a mediator between the ViewModel and the data sources (such as a database or web service).
* **base** - the base module contains *Base Fragment*, *Base ViewModel* and *Base Adapter* to reduce the code duplication
* **di** - It contains `Koin` modules for dependency injection.
* **extensions** - Kotlin extensions to reduce boilerplate code.
* **model** - Contains all the Data Class (POJO)
* **utils** - Utility Classes like App Constant and Custom functions
